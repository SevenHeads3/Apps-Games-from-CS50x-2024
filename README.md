I did based on a very common game, it is very simple, yet very fun (at least for the first try), also, the first game I designed, thanks for everyone who played (even if nobody does :D)

Spot wants to play with you! yes, you!
your objective is to guess the Secret Number, if you guess the wrong number, Spot will tell you if the number guessed is higher or lower than the Secret Number, Good Luck!
(along the gameplay Spot will ask questions, wich can be answered by clicking on the buttons that shall appear.)
